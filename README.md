Hi there, whoever stumbles onto this page!

My name is John Hardberger, and this is a portfolio/personal website I built for myself. I graduated from General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course, and I'm currently seeking work in Chicago. I'm a strong all-around dev but am particuarly handy with React, and have a passion for front-end work that incorporates pleasing, user-friendly design. Hopefully this portfolio reflects that. 

If you're interested in contacting me (about work or something else, who knows?), please drop me a line at john (dot) hardberger (at) gmail (dot) com. Cheers!
