								<p>As an avid music listener with wide-ranging tastes, I've always found Spotify's Discovery feature a little limited: As a user, it rarely feels like you're really "discovering" anything so much as being spoonfead a random mash of vaguely similar artists. This is partially because Spotify doesn't share with its users any of the metrics by which it organizes its tunes. 
								</p>
								<p>BeatGrinder is my attempt to create a more organic music discovery experience. It's a full-stack app built with React and Node.js that makes extensive use of the Spotify API. A user can log in with their Spotify account and create "grinds" â€” never-ending playlists that a user can customize using the musical qualities that Spotify assigns, behind the scenes, to every song. Think of a it as a responsive radio station that lets you set the vibe.

								<p>Built in conjuntion with my General Assembly classmate Chris Lehman, Mapulate is a full-stack app that helps users learn about U.S. city and state populations. In "practice" mode, a user can click or use a search bar to navigate a map of the U.S. and see the populations of various regions. Then, in "game" mode, a user can put their knowledge to the test with several quizes and question types. 
								</p>
								<p>My main contributions to the project were focused around its user interface, which I created in React. I'm particularly proud of the clickable polygons on the map, which work through the Google Maps React API.

								<p>Making use the Discogs API, Waxxy is record collecting app the world deserves. Taking cues from other media-centric social media sites like GoodReads and Letterbox, Waxxy aims to tap into the community aspect of cratedigging with visually pleasing, easy-to-use design. A user can create a digital catalogue of their LPs, organize that collection into shelves, leave personallized "liner notes" on records, and interact with other users to discuss their favorite music. 
								</p>
								<p>For this project, I worked on both the front and back end, writing parts of the interface as well as wrangling the Discogs API. Both I and Charlotte Prevost, the General Assembly classmate with whom I co-developed the project, hope to return to Waxxy and flesh it out in the near future.

								<p>The first code I wrote (that's fit to share), Qwerty Derby is a pick-up-and-play typing game that doesn't pull any punches: it's both surprisingly difficult and surprisingly addicting. Just try to keep up with those verbal fastballs, because, as in real baseball, it's three strikes and you're out!
